			<h2><small>Online Best Business</small> Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>Online Best Business ("Hi") knows that you take your privacy seriously. We do, too. We are committed to giving you transparency of our privacy practices and control over your data in connection with Hi's Services (as defined in Hi's <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>). </p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy covers Hi's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information" ) and other data that Hi gathers when you are accessing Hi's Services. The Services are not available to individuals who are younger than 13 years old.</p>
			<h4>What Personal Information Does Hi Collect?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Services or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, phone number, birthday, Twitter and/or Facebook usernames, location, use information regarding your use of our Services, and browser information. We automatically receive your location when you use the Services. We use various technologies to determine location, such as location services of the applicable operating system or browser and sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi- access points and cell towers. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Services, improving the content of the Services, customizing the advertising and content you and your friends see (including Hi or third-party advertising or content), and communicating with you about specials and new features. Your Services account will be associated with your username (and optionally with a phone number and email) and this account will be used for all our Services that you use. Information you provide to one of our Services may be used with other Services you or your friends use. For example, location information we receive in connection with your use of one of our apps may be used to customize the content you and your friends see in another of our apps. We may also draw upon this Personal Information in order to adapt the Services of our community to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and Services, and to develop new tools for the community.</li>
				<li>Information Collected Automatically: When you use the Services, Hi automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, browser type, operating information, mobile carrier, device and application IDs, cookie information, and the page you requested. We treat this data as non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, Hi only uses this data in aggregate form. We may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our Services, so that our partners may also understand how often people use their services and our Services.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>How is My Information Shared?</h4>
			<p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone, though, as described more fully in this section below, your publicly-available information is available to third parties, and we may provide it to third parties, by license or otherwise. Hi may share your Personal Information only as described in this Privacy Policy and related documents.</p>
			<p>Friends on Hi : Your friends on Hi can see, for example, your location, username, links to your Twitter and Facebook accounts (if you have connected those accounts to your Hi account), a list of your friends.</p>

			<h4>Determining and Sharing Location</h4>
			<p>Determining your location - The Services deal with location, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services experience to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips). This information is NOT shared with others. Also, the Services use your mobile device’s ‘background location’ to provide the Services, including notifications. If you have ‘background location’ turned on, the Hi app will, from time to time, tell us about your device’s location even if you are not directly interacting with the application.</p>
			<p>Sharing Location with the Hi app - Your real-time location is not shared on the Hi app. If you write a tip, like or otherwise interact with a place, users may infer that you have been to that location.</p>

			<h4>Services Features</h4>
			<p>The Services include several features that may allow you to share your information with others. For each of these and our other features, the information available to friends and others. Please remember that if you choose to provide personal information using certain features of the Services, that information may be available to the wider Services community, or may be published on our Sites, which is subject to indexing by third party search engines.</p>
			<h4>Sharing with Partners, in connection with business transfers, and for the protection of Hi and others:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Our Partners: In addition to the data sharing described above, we enter into relationships with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses, provide services to you, sell items or provide promotions to you through the Services. In other situations, Hi provides services, or sells items jointly with these businesses. You can easily recognize when one of these businesses is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that business.</li>
				<li>Business Transfers: If Hi or substantially all of its assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Hi goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</li>
				<li>Protection of Hi and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law, including laws outside your country of residence; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Hi, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations (including outside of your country of residence) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
